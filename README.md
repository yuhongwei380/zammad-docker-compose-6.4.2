## Upgrading

For upgrading instructions, see our [Releases](https://github.com/zammad/zammad-docker-compose/releases).

## Running without Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch is an optional, but strongly recommended dependency for Zammad. More details can be found in the [documentation](https://docs.zammad.org/en/latest/prerequisites/software.html#elasticsearch-optional). There are however certain scenarios when running without Elasticsearch may be desired, e.g. for very small teams, for teams with limited budget or as a temporary solution for an unplanned Elasticsearch downtime or planned cluster upgrade.

Elasticsearch is enabled by default in the example `docker-compose.yml` file. It is also by default required to run the "zammad-init" command. Disabling Elasticsearch is possible by setting a special environment variable: `ELASTICSEARCH_ENABLED=false` and loading
the scenario [disable-elasticsearch-service.yml](scenarios/disable-elasticsearch-service.yml).
